# Ultrasound-image-of-breast-classification
Classification of breast cancers(malignant,benign or without tumor)
Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aryashah2k/breast-ultrasound-images-dataset

Hello!
Welcome to my multi-class classification project. I was classifying tumors (malignant,benign and lack of tumor) on ultrasound photos of breast. I used convolutional neural network combined with Random Forest which is learning on convolution filters parameters and then predicting the class. I achieved high metrics of accuracy, precision and other metrics (accuracy about 85-95% depending on training dataset) and it is correctly classifying new single photos. I encourage you to read the full documentation and code included in .ipynb file.
